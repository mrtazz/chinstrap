# chinstrap - mustache C library

## Overview
chinstrap is a C library which provides [mustache](http://mustache.github.com)
template processing. It is intended to be easily usable as a library which can
be bound from other languages. It takes a more academic approach to compiling
mustache templates and provides such things as a scanner, lexer and parser.

Chinstrap uses 4 stages for successfully rendering mustache templates. The
scanner runs through the template and emits single characters to work with. In
the next stage the lexer creates meaningful (in the mustache context) tokens of
the retrieved characters. These token are then given to the parser, which knows
the [state machine]() to render mustache templates and creates a parse tree
based on it. The parse tree is then passed to the renderer along with the
context to create the rendered template.

## API
